## Project 1: Number Guessing Game

**Description:** The number guessing game allows the user to guess a random number between 1 and 10. The program provides feedback on whether the guess was correct or not and limits the user to three attempts.

**How to Play:**

1. Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment.

2. You will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 10. Enter your guess and press Enter.

3. If your guess matches the randomly generated number, you win the game, and the program will display "Guessed Number is correct."

4. If your guess does not match the random number, the program will display "Sorry!! You failed in guessing the number."

5. You will have a total of 3 attempts to guess the correct number.

6. After you have made your guesses, the program will reveal the correct number.

7. The game will end, and you can choose to play again or exit the program.
